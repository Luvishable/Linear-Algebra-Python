# SUBSPACES

# A subspace is defined as the set of all vectors that can be created by taking linear combinations of some vector
# or a set of vectors. Linear combination in this case means multiplication by a scalar, and that scalar can be
# any real valued number.

# You can create a subspace from two vectors by considering all possible linear combinations of these two vectors.

# A vector subspace must be closed under addition and scalar multiplication and contain the zero vector.

# All subspaces intersect at the origin because all subspaces must necesserily include the origin.

# There is zero-dimensional subspace which is just the point at the origin. There is just one zero-dimensional
# subspace

# Then there is a one dimensional subspace which is defined by a line, and there is infinite number of one-dimensional
# subspaces embedded inside ambient three dimensional subspace.

# Next we have the two dimensional subspace, which is a plane. And again there is infinite number of two dimensional
# subspaces that can be embedded inside an ambient 3 dimensional subspace.

# There is exactly one three dimensional subspace that fits inside a three dimensional ambient space.


# SUBSPACES vs. SUBSETS

# Subset is a set of points that satisfies some conditions:
#   Doesn't need to include the origin
#   Doesn't need to be closed.
#   Can have boundaries

# When you want to determine if it's a subset or subspace first of all check if the origin is in the set.
